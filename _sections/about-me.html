<p>Maeda Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison studies evolutionary diversification of core metabolic pathways (i.e. primary metabolism) in various plants through chemical, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary analyses. 
  Utilizing the acquired basic knowledge, we further aim to optimize plant metabolic network and improve chemical compositions of agricultural and bioenergy crops, such as for improved food nutrition, plant-based bioenergy 
  and pharmaceutical production. For more information visit https://maeda.botany.wisc.edu/.</p>
