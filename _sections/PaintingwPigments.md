Kids can see that plants beautiful pigments, and now they can use them to paint!

## Learning Goals

* Get children to recognize that plants produce Pigments and Dyes
* These dyes are different chemicals, and will act differently in different chemical environments
* These Pigments can be valuable and humans can use them, not just for painting but they are good to eat as well!

## Activity:

1. Children are given a blank piece of construction paper, and vials of pigments of various colors that have been isolated from plants that are placed in front of them.

2. Children paint images with the pigments like watercolors, and can guess what pigments came from what plants.

3. Once they are done painting, children can choose to put their painting into the two different solutions, either water or ethanol. Depending upon which solution they choose, different pigments will "move" because of the chemical nature of those pigments, either being hydrophilic (dissolves well in water) or hydrophobic (does not dissolve in water)
