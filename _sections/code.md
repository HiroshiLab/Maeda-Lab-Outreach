Using this screen-free activity, students can grasp the concepts of coding.

## Computer Science Learning Goals:

* Design code to guide a robot through a maze and complete tasks
* Identify ways of simplifying their code
* Recognize relationships between the structure of the code and the structure of the maze
* Understand the cycle of running, modifying, and then rerunning code

## Activity

1. The goal is given a maze, students must guide a ‘robot’ (played by an instructor or one of the students) through the maze while accomplishing specific goals which are different for each maze. They guide the robot by putting together a code of specific instructions for the robot to follow. Using the instructions given, the robot follows them to accomplish the task.

2. Command codes:

3. Rules for the current maze:

* You must get 3 $ (candy) and go from start to finish.
* Robot only listens to the code- code usually taped up on the blackboard and must be in the order that the robot can follow.
* The robot cannot move out of the maze.
* The robot can only move into an unoccupied tile or a tile with a candy.
* The robot cannot move in a space without pushing the box out of the way. The box is always pushed forward one space in the direction the robot is headed. The box cannot be pushed outside of the maze.
* Robot can jump over a gap in the maze by using jump.

4. Start the maze!
